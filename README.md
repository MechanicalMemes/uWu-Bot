## Welcome!
This is the working directory and project for the FTC Team *Mechanical Memes 7195*. This is our comptetion bot code, and also the project where we develop our tools and library. This should be taken as state-of-the-art for new features.

## Disclaimer
Since this is the working project, we do not officially support any software in here unless specifically specified. However I still welcome bug reports and feedback on this repo so I can catch bugs before they make in into release.
